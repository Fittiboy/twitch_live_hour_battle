# Twitch Live Hour Battle
Experiment that failed... [or did it](https://youtu.be/TN25ghkfgQA "The original Twitch Helix API endpoint /schedule wouldn't have worked for this, but the /videos endpoint does!")?  
This will provide a simple API for Twitch chat bots to call, to display the total live hours of a streamer, for the current month.  
Pit your favorite streamers against each other!
